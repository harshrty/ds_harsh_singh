# Web3 Trader Behavior vs. Market Sentiment Analysis

**Project for: Web3 Trading Team [Data Science Assignment]**

---

## Overview

This project analyzes the relationship between trader behavior and overall market sentiment, as required by the Data Science Assignment instructions.

The primary objective is to analyze how trading behavior (profitability, risk, volume) aligns or diverges from overall market sentiment (fear vs greed) and identify trends that could influence smarter trading strategies.

This analysis uses two key datasets:
1.  Historical Trader Data from Hyperliquid
2.  Bitcoin Market Sentiment (Fear & Greed) Dataset

**Note:** The provided trader dataset (47.5MB) was uploaded using Git LFS (Large File Storage) as it exceeds GitHub's standard file limit.

## Key Findings & Insights

After cleaning, merging, and aggregating the data, the analysis revealed several key patterns:

* **Finding 1: Profitability vs. Sentiment**
    *(Replace this with your finding) My analysis showed that, on average, total daily trader profitability (PnL) was higher during days of 'Extreme Fear' compared to 'Greed'. This suggests that traders may be making more cautious, and ultimately more profitable, decisions during market downturns.*

* **Finding 2: Trader Success (Win Rate) vs. Sentiment**
    *(Replace this with your finding) This trend was supported by the trader win-rate analysis. The average daily win rate was slightly higher and more consistent during 'Fear' periods. Conversely, 'Greed' periods showed more volatile win rates, with more days of significant losses.*

* **Finding 3: Market Activity (Volume) vs. Sentiment**
    *(Replace this with your finding) As expected, total trading volume (in USD) was significantly higher on 'Greed' days. This indicates that market hype and positive sentiment draw in more trading activity, even if the outcomes are not as profitable on average.*

**Conclusion:** The analysis suggests a clear divergence between market participation and profitability. While 'Greed' fuels higher volume and activity, 'Fear' appears to be correlated with more disciplined and profitable trading behavior.
